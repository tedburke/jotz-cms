title: Example Blog Post
...

## This is an example section heading

This is a paragraph of text, made up of a series of sentences. Each sentence ends with a full stop.
In markdown, if you start a new line without leaving a blank line, the text still be part of the same paragraph as the text above it.

If you leave a blank line, that starts a new paragraph.

You can format text in *italics* by surrounding it with a pair of asterisks. To format text in **bold** surround it with double asterisks.

## Lists in markdown

It's easy to create a bullet list in markdown. Just write each item on a separate line, starting with a hyphen and a space. For example,

- This is the first item in a bullet list.
- This is the second item in the list.
- This is the third and final item.

Numbered lists are just as easy:

1. You don't even have to increment the numbers yourself on successive lines.
1. Just start every line with "1. " and the items will be automatically numbered in sequence.
1. That's actually very useful because you can insert a item into the middle of an existing numbered list without having to fix any of the numbers.

## Inserting links and images

Creating web links is easy too. Just write the text to be displayed in square brackets, followed by the URL (i.e. web address) in round brackets. For example, here's a [link to the TU Dublin web page](https://www.tudublin.ie/).

Inserting an image is similar to inserting a link, except that it begins with an exclamation mark:

![Describe the image in words here](https://tedz.eu/uploads/alice_bob_pair_programming_screenshot.png)

## Embedding a YouTube video in markdown

Embedding a YouTube video is easy when you know how too...

There are lots of other things you can do with markdown, but that's enough for now!
